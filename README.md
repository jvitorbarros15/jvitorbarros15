# Hi, I am Joao Vitor Barros da Silva

I am a Computer Science senior at Penn State focused on AI, machine learning, blockchain, and quantum secure communication.  
I work on high impact projects that combine research and engineering, and I enjoy building technology that solves real problems at scale.  
Currently, I am a lead researcher at Penn State’s Blockchain Data Intelligence Lab, where I develop QLink, a quantum safe interoperability protocol that uses QKD and PQC to secure blockchain bridges. I am and also a software developer for Penn State Libraries where I work alongside the team using Ruby on Rails to maintain Univeristy's websites and services.

## What I am working on

### QLink  
Quantum safe Layer 3 bridge that uses QKD and PQC to secure cross chain communication.  
I simulated a 7 validator network with 5 to 50 km fiber links and reached up to 707 times surplus key throughput and under 1 second latency. This outperformed classical bridges by more than 400 times in cross chain key refresh rate.\

### NFL 4th Down Predictor  
Machine learning model using 480K NFL plays to predict fourth down conversions.  
Reached 62 percent accuracy with calibrated probability metrics.

### ZorAi  
Full stack decentralized app to verify AI generated images on chain.  
Processed over 5 thousand images with 99 percent detection accuracy and under 2 seconds latency.

## Experience

### Software Development Intern at Penn State University Libraries  
Working with Ruby on Rails and Docker to support more than 40 thousand users.  

Built a Python Pandas pipeline that cleaned faculty data from 17.7 thousand to 9.8 thousand accurate entries and reduced manual processing time by more than 90 percent.

Member of the development team for a large scale PDF remediation and accessibility platform built with AWS and Adobe, supporting over 3 million PDF uploads and improving document accessibility through automated parsing and secure S3 storage.

Designed and implemented a cross system data integration API to POST JSON between independent websites, created JSON to XML importers, produced Swagger documentation, and reduced manual departmental data handling by approximately 60 percent through cross team collaboration.

### Lead Researcher at Penn State Blockchain Data Intelligence Lab  
Developing quantum secure blockchain bridges using QKD, PQC, and validator consensus.
